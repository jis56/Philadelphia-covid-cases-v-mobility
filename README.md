# Project 1

Our project aims to examine the trends between changes in mobility percentage from baseline and COVID-19 cases in the counties of Pennsylvania, which was then narrowed down to the county of Philadelphia. Two CSV files from New York Times and Google were used for this project which can be found in the resources folder. We aimed to answer the following questions using this data:

* Is there any correlation between mobility change % and COVID-19 cases?
* Do positive/negative spikes in COVID-19 cases affect mobility changes?
